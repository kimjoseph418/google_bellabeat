The visualizations above show that users that used the FitBit tracker device had consistent lifestyles throughout the week, with slightly higher activity during the weekend. This suggests that the users were working in a traditional working environment and spending their personal time over the weekends.\n\nWe also see that users have little to no activity from 12am to 4am, while activity is at its highest in the afternoon from 12pm to 6pm. Bellabeat can explore adding notifications based on time, reminding the user to exercise during peak hours in the afternoon, and to get ready for bed around midnight.\n\n#### Sleep quality\nWe can see from the distributions of sleep quality throughout the week that users had more irregular sleeping patterns during the weekend as opposed to the weekend. We also saw a decrease in optimal sleep quality (7-9 hours) during the weekend as well. This suggests that users depart from their weekday routines during the weekend, leading to these irregularities. Bellabeat can look into adding a feature to customize notifications and set custom routines for weekdays and weekend separately, emphasizing the impact it would have to the users' quality of sleep.\n\n#### Tracking calories\nFinally, we see a positive correlation between total steps taken and calories burnt. While this is a generall known fact, it is supported by the correlation being positive. This can help set a daily walking goal and inform users the impact it has in total calories burnt.","metadata":{}}]}
